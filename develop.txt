Camera Buddy 
============

Development Instructions
------------------------

Camera Buddy is a small application to download photos from your camera. It can
place photos nicely arranged in directory levels using date time stamps.
Optionally, it can rotate your photos and adjust the time they were taken.

1. Repository

This application in maintained with "git". Before doing anything to a locally
checked-out version, make sure you pull all the changes from the master
location.

$ git pull

2. Tagging

Tagging is important everytime a release is done. To tag, issue:

$ git tag (-s) <tagname> 

If you want to tag the head version of the current branch.

$ git tag (-s) <tagname> <abbreviated-commit>

If you want to tag a particular commit. You can get a list of commits with:

$ git log --format=format:"%h %s"

The "-s" flag tells git to sign the commit.

After tagging is done, you need to recompile the package, so the "About" window
is updated correctly.

3. Packaging

After the application has been tested, you can distributed in the format of a
DMG image, which is the standard for OSX applications.

A template is shipped with the package. Look for '.dmg' files in the current
directory. If you cannot find any, you can create a new template following
the instructions in this webpage: http://digital-sushi.org/entry/how-to-create-a-disk-image-installer-for-apple-mac-os-x/

The Background to be used is based on Pixelmator's format. You have to convert
it into a jpeg and follow the instructions on the link above to set the
backgrond of the installer window.

After creating the template, in case you build a new version of the software,
you can update the application like this:

$ hdiutil convert CameraBuddy.dmg -format UDSP -o CameraBuddy
$ rm -f CameraBuddy.dmg
$ hdiutil mount CameraBuddy.sparseimage
$ rm -rf '/Volumes/Camera Buddy/Camera Buddy.app/Contents'
$ cp -r 'build/Release/Camera Buddy.app/Contents' '/Volumes/Camera Buddy/Camera Buddy.app/Contents' 
$ hdiutil unmount '/Volumes/Camera Buddy'
$ hdiutil convert CameraBuddy.sparseimage -format UDBZ -o CameraBuddy.dmg

The package needs signing for Sparkle updates. Here is how to do that:

$ openssl dgst -sha1 -binary < <dsa-private-key> | openssl dgst -dss1 -sign CameraBuddy.dmg | openssl enc -base64

And finally, you have to move it into a "versioned" name. Check the package
tags and choose an appropriate setting.

$ cp CameraBuddy.dmg CameraBuddy-X.Y.Z.dmg

Do *not* move the DMG file as we normally keep it into the repository so it
works as a template in future updates.
